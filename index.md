# The Meta-DAO: An experiment in human coordination

The Meta-DAO is a new cybernetic institution managed by programs stored
on [the Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/). Instead of token-voting or
[liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20liquid%20democracy,a%20trusted%20person%20or%20party.), the Meta-DAO uses [futarchy](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html).

On November x 2023, the Meta-DAO will be opened to the world. Anyone will be
able to participate in the *initial bootstrapping event*, which will distribute
the Meta-DAO's native token. After the event, the Meta-DAO will allocate its
capital and make its decisions according to the rules of futarchy.

These docs are intended to give an overview of the Meta-DAO, answering questions
like:
- Why create a new institution?
- How does futarchy work? Why might it be better than existing approaches to
human coordination?
- Who created the Meta-DAO?
- How can I participate in the initial bootstrapping event?
