# The Meta-DAO

An experiment in human coordination
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


The Meta-DAO is a new cybernetic institution managed by programs stored
on [the Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/). Instead of 
[token-voting](https://acceleratedcapital.substack.com/i/36799446/ii-token-based-quorum-voting) or
[liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20liquid%20democracy,a%20trusted%20person%20or%20party.), 
the Meta-DAO uses [futarchy](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html).
