The Meta-DAO is a new experiment in human coordination. It will be the first instance of
[futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html),
a novel governance mechanism invented by economist Robin Hanson in 2000. Starting
on October x 2023, anyone will be able to exchange SOL for META tokens in the
Meta-DAO's bootstrapping event.

These docs serve to answer a few common questions, including:

- **What** is futarchy? **Why** does it matter?
- **How** will the bootstrapping event work?
- **Who** are the Meta-DAO's creator(s)?
