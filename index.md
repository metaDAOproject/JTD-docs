**The Meta-DAO** is a new experiment in human coordination. It will be the first instance of
[futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html),
a novel governance mechanism invented by economist Robin Hanson in 2000. 

These docs serve as an approachable introduction to the Meta-DAO, answering
questions like:

- What is futarchy? Why does it matter?
- How, specifically, does the Meta-DAO use futarchy?
- How will the bootstrapping event work?
- Who are the Meta-DAO's creator(s)?
