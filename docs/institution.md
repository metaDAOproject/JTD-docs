# Why build a new institution?

Why are some places rich and some places poor? People have some varying responses
to this question, including genetics (social Darwinism), culture, and geography.
However, none of those responses are correct, because they fail to explain the
large disparities between North Korea and South Korea, Hong Kong / Taiwan and
Mainland China, and Nogales, Mexico, and Nogales, Arizona. In each of these
cases, the people, cultures, and geographies were near-identical. So why are
there such large wealth disparities?

**The answer is institutions.** In some places, the prevailing institutions
incentivize people to do things that are socially beneficial, like invent new
products or invest capital into factories. In others, the prevailing institutions
encourage people to do things that are socially harmful, like take bribes in
exchange for protecting an industry that is ripe for disruption.

We believe the difference between our present-day world and one that has adopted
better institutions could be just as large as the difference between North and South
Korea.
