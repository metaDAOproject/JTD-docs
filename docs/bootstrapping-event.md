# Initial Bootstrapping Event

How the Meta-DAO will bootstrap futarchy and distribute its tokens
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Purpose

Many crypto projects opt for an approach of gradual decentralization, where a centralized
start-up builds the core products of the project and then slowly passes control
over those products to the community. This is fine for most projects but doesn't
align with our goals.

Instead, the Meta-DAO will *start* decentralized. We will bootstrap this with
an *initial bootstrapping event* which will distribute the META token. In the
bootstrapping event, anyone will be able to buy META with SOL, and their SOL
will go directly to the Meta-DAO's treasury.

From there, the SOL could be used to build products under the Meta-DAO umbrella
(like a normal company), fund other projects in exchange for financial upside (like a VC
fund), or even acquire other projects (like a blank check company).

*Important to remember is that the Meta-DAO is an experiment. Although the
experiment may suceed and reshape the way that human civilization is organized,
it may also fail. You should view the initial bootstrapping event as an opportunity
to participate in this experiment, not as an opportunity to invest in an enterprise
that will be legally bound to deliver you profits.*

## Distribution

There will be no pre-mine or team allocation. All META will be distributed 
through the initial bootstrapping event.

Later, the Meta-DAO could mint new META, which could be used for accretive activities like
compensating contributors or performing acquisitions. But that would be subject to
the same futarchic decision-making process that every proposal is subject to.

## Mechanics

WIP

We are considering either an [Ethereum-style](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale) uncapped issuance or a [Strata-style](https://github.com/StrataFoundation/strata)
liquidity bootstrapping pool.
