# Initial Bootstrapping Event

How the Meta-DAO will bootstrap futarchy and distribute its tokens
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Purpose

Many crypto projects opt for an approach of gradual decentralization, where a centralized
start-up builds the core products of the project and then slowly passes control
over those products to the community. This is fine for most projects but doesn't
align with our goals. Instead, the Meta-DAO *started* decentralized.

## Mechanics

On November 8th 2023, Proph3t took a snapshot of those eligible for the airdrop.
On November 15th, the airdrop was distributed to those who scored at least a 7/10
on the quiz. More can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/_rfw7y8sQrKOnCU3MW1i1g).

All 10,000 of META's circulating supply was distributed by this airdrop, with
the remaining 990,000 META held by the Meta-DAO's treasury. To bootstrap the
Meta-DAO, Proph3t deposited 10,000 USDC into the Meta-DAO's treasury.
