# Motivation

Why build a new institution? What problem are we solving?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Institutions are the driving force of our existence

> *An institution is a humanly devised structure of rules and norms that shape
> and constrain individual behavior.*\
> Wikipedia, [September 2023 Edition](http://web.archive.org/web/20230922203543/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution)

Institutions are *really* important. By shaping our decisions and actions,
they decide whether our societies prosper or falter. 

Consider, for example,
the difference of livelihood between the average Somali and the average German.
In a country where murder and kidnapping are common,
42% of the population doesn't have access to basic drinking
water services, and GDP per capita is only $462,
the average Somali lives in bleak circumstances.[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]
The average German, on the other hand, has access
to decent secondary and tertiary education, lives without the fear of terrorists
capturing and plundering their town, and earns 45,457 Euros per year.[^4]<sup>,</sup>[^5] 

At the root of the issue is a difference in institutions. Germany has strong property
rights, which incentivizes people to produce things and develop their land.[^6]<sup>,</sup>[^7]
Somalia
has weak property rights, and it hardly seems worth producing things when the local
militants will extract away all of your profits.[^8]<sup>,</sup>[^9] Germany 
is a democracy where
political leaders must win the votes of their constituents; Somalia is an anarchy
where power is won by bullets instead of ballots. Institutions are the source
of Somalia's problems and of Germany's comparative abundance.[^10]

## Our institutions are failing us

> *The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, 
> near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.*\
> Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page, [Testing Theories in American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens](https://archive.org/details/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc/mode/2up)

Still,
the comparatively
superior institutions of the West are far from perfect.
For example, because the incentive to research political candidates
is low, so-called democracies function more like plutocracies.[^11]<sup>,</sup>[^12] 
Because economies
don't reward the creation or maintenance of [public goods](https://metaproph3t.github.io/posts/public_goods.html),
not enough time or resources goes to creating and maintaining them.[^13]<sup>,</sup>[^14]
And although corporations are generally painted as rational and profit-maximizing,
empirical research shows that boards of directors are often misaligned with shareholders
and that managers
are often selected and compensated based on their ability to network
rather than their ability to drive results.[^15]<sup>,</sup>[^16]<sup>,</sup>[^17] 

## A radical new approach is needed

Basically, we need a new approach. Better leadership cannot save us when the
machine that selects the leaders is broken. Instead, we must create a
new alternative system. While [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) 
provides an alternative money and [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)
provides an alternative financial system, we need an alternative society.
