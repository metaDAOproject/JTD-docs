# Motivation

## Institutions are the driving force of our existence

> An institution is a humanly devised structure of rules and norms that shape
> and constrain individual behavior.\
> *Wikipedia*, [September 2023 Edition](http://web.archive.org/web/20230922203543/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution)

Institutions are important. By shaping our decisions and actions,
they decide whether our societies prosper or falter. 

Consider, for example,
the difference of livelihood between the average Somali and the average German.
In a country where murder and kidnapping are common[^1],
42% of the population doesn't have access to basic drinking
water services[^2], and GDP per capita is only $462[^3],
the average Somali lives in bleak circumstances.
The average German, on the other hand, earns 45,457 Euros per year[^4], has access
to decent secondary and tertiary education[^5], and lives without the fear of terrorists
capturing and plundering their town. The difference is not that the
Germans are intrinsically peaceful creatures and the Somalis are intrinsically violent
or that
Germany is stocked full of natural resources while Somalia lays barren; the difference
is institutions. Germany prospers while Somalia falters because it has superior
institutions.

## Our institutions are failing us

Still, as those of us who live in the Western world know, the comparatively
superior institutions are far from perfect.
Because the incentive to research political candidates
is low, so-called democracies function more like plutocracies.[^6] [^7] Because
boards of directors are insufficiently aligned with shareholders' interests,
managers are often selected and compensated based on their ability to schmooze
rather than their ability to drive results.[^8] [^9] [^10] And because economies
don't reward the creation or maintenance of [public goods](https://metaproph3t.github.io/posts/public_goods.html),
not enough time or resources goes to creating and maintaining them.[^11][^12]

## A radical new approach is needed

Basically, we need a new approach. Better leadership cannot save us when the
machine that selects the leaders is broken. We must not wait for our politicians
and business managers to become virtuous and smart. Instead, we must create a
new alternative system. While [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) 
provides an alternative money and [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)
provides an alternative financial system, we need an alternative society.
