# Scalability

Designs that would allow the Meta-DAO to scale
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The careful reader may realize that futarchy doesn't scale. That is, it's good
for big decisions like whether to fire the CEO, but less so for smaller decisions
like whether to fire a division leader, because those actions may be too
inconsequential to reflect in the share price.

We designed a solution to this
problem, which is described [here](https://github.com/metaDAOproject/Manifesto/blob/main/Manifesto.pdf)
and 
[here](https://medium.com/@metaproph3t/from-corporations-to-nations-how-the-meta-dao-is-going-to-change-everything-part-3-16b3880fd86c).[^1]

To be clear, the Meta-DAO will be launched as a simple futarchy, not using these
designs. But it would be possible to migrate in the future if the market decied
it do.
