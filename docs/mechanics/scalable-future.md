# Scalability

Designs that would allow the Meta-DAO to scale
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The careful reader may realize that futarchy doesn't scale. That is, it's good
for big decisions like whether to fire the CEO, but less so for smaller decisions
like whether to fire a division leader because those actions may be too
inconsequential to reflect in the share price.

We designed a solution to this
problem, which is described [here](https://github.com/metaDAOproject/Manifesto/blob/main/Manifesto.pdf)
and 
[here](https://medium.com/@metaproph3t/from-corporations-to-nations-how-the-meta-dao-is-going-to-change-everything-part-3-16b3880fd86c).[^1]

The Meta-DAO will be launched without using these mechanics. But it would be possible
to migrate to this design in the future.
