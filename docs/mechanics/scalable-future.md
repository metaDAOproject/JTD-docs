# Future designs for scalability

The careful reader may realize that futarchy doesn't scale. That is, it's good
for big decisions like whether to fire the CEO, but less so for smaller decisions
like whether to fire a division leader, because those actions may be too
inconsequential to reflect in the share price. We designed a solution to this
problem, which is described [here](https://github.com/metaDAOproject/Manifesto/blob/main/Manifesto.pdf)
and 
[here](https://medium.com/@metaproph3t/from-corporations-to-nations-how-the-meta-dao-is-going-to-change-everything-part-3-16b3880fd86c).[^1]
In the interest of starting small and iterating, the Meta-DAO will be launched
as basic futarchy, the scheme described above. But it would be possible to migrate
to a more scalable scheme in the future, if the market decided it so.
